Trucker wallet with a zipped pocket. A few practical pockets inside to hold your cards, money, receipts or whatever you wish. Solid brass snaps keep the flap closed firmly and enrich the looks. This wallet has a great, luxurious feel and makes you feel the true richness of vegetable tanned leather. An accordion-like construction makes it very elastic and easy to pick your stuff from pockets.
