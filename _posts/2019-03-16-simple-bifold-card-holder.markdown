The simplest card holder in my collection, yet still allowing to fully experience the beauty and luxury of vegetable tanned leather. A great choice when you need something really small to keep the essentials cards with you. Due to its slimness it’s a great wallet to put in your jacket. It’s got three pockets, two inner ones and one on the outside.
